# Hello-World-Fun

## A World Of Saying Hello

# Overview

This is a fun introduction into coding and writing programs. I plan on tackling much longer and more in-depth problems but we all start somewhere in the journey of learning to write well documented code.

This is a very simple code that combines three variables each containing a string to print out the statement hello world

My purpose for creating this software was to test my coding environment to insure I am able to upload to git use python and make sure this IDE works for what I need it to do.
